# Small Web

Welcome to anhgelus's logs. 

Bienvenue dans les logs d'anhgelus.

## Concept

Personnal website in the vibe of the small web mouvance.
It aims to be simple, minimalist, brutalist, indie, and personnal.

## How it works

Backend written in modern Go.

Light CSS, light JS, runs everywhere.
SSR first.
Maybe HTMX?

Content written in markdown.

RSS feed.

## Organization

This repository contains only the source code of the website, not the contents.

Mock-ups are in `design`.
Only HTML and raw CSS here.
